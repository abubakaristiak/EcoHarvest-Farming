## Introduction

EcoHarvest Farming integrates modern technology with traditional farming methods to enhance crop yield, reduce resource consumption, and minimize environmental impact. This repository contains the initial design of the user interface and a comprehensive report detailing the project's vision, objectives, and proposed functionalities.

## Project Overview

EcoHarvest Farming aims to provide:
- **IoT Monitoring**: Conceptualized real-time data collection from soil moisture sensors, temperature, humidity, and other environmental parameters.
- **Automated Irrigation**: Proposed intelligent irrigation system that adjusts water supply based on soil moisture levels.
- **Data Analytics**: Planned advanced data analytics to provide insights and recommendations for optimizing farming practices.
- **Sustainable Practices**: Focus on reducing chemical use, conserving water, and maintaining soil health.

## UI Design

The UI design provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for farmers and stakeholders to interact with the EcoHarvest Farming system. The design includes:
- **Dashboard**: Visual representation of data and analytics.
- **Sensor Monitoring**: Interface to view real-time data from IoT sensors.
- **Irrigation Control**: Control panel for automated irrigation systems.
- **Reports and Insights**: Section to view detailed reports and recommendations.
